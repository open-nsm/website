**OpenNSM** is a weekly network security monitoring group without geographical
borders.

We're not aware of any other active NSM user groups in the United States, and
have the ambitious goal of being a premier place for students, professionals,
and hobbyists, from all over to share their research, tools, and techniques in a
laid back and friendly environment.
